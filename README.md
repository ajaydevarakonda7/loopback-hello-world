# Loopback Hello World
We'll look into loopback 4.0 basics and write down some stuff.

## Folder structure
1. `.vscode` - It can helpus run debugger on vscode.
2. `public/index.html` - Page, displays links to api specification(auto generated) and explorer.

### `src` folder
1. `application.ts` -
2. `index.ts` -
3. `migrate.ts` -
4. `sequence.ts` -
5.

## Concepts
1. `Datasource` - Same as lb3, memory / persistent data source / destination.
2. `Models` - They are like mongoose models in lb4.
3. `Repositories` - In loopback 3 Models are where every thing is implemented, but repositories are the place to define methods in lb4. We use repositories to create routes with `Model + Datasource`
